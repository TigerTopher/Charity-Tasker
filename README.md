## To Do

* Still working on front-end Charities page not showing the footer if possible.
* Need to create more links based on the category of the challenge
* Video upload in the challenge page. The goal is that a video must be uploaded before a user can click on the "Completed" status. 
* Seperate challenges based on status (incomplete vs completed)
* insert pages to the "Challenges" lists.
* Stripe test integration.
